A Python 3 plus Tkinter script to browse all Python source, listing functions, classes and methods in all modules.

Launches an editor for any file, does searches across an entire tree, launches the command line window and executes a command line. Copies function call and class instantiation snippets to the clipboard for pasting into source code.

I found this helpful after my Python codebase got too large to rummage through by the usual methods.

Only for Linux. It can probably be adapted for Windows, but I'm not motivated myself.
